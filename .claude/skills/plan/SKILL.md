1. **Summary** — One paragraph on the approach
2. **Files to change** — Each file with what changes and why
3. **Files to create** — Each new file with its purpose
4. **Steps** — Numbered, ordered, each with:
- Step N: [description]
- Files: [which files]
- Verify: [command to confirm — test, typecheck, etc.]

5. **Risks** — What could go wrong
6. **Open questions** — Anything needing human input
